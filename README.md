Exploratory Data analysis on mental health among collenge students using python  
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project that focuses on understanding the prevalence of anxiety and depression among college students. 
The project aims to provide insights into the mental health landscape among students using data analysis techniques and Python programming.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes anonymized survey responses from college students regarding their mental health status.
It includes information about anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and related factors. 
The data was collected through a structured survey designed to assess the mental well-being of students.
The dataset were taken from Kaggel.
# Analysis Techniques
In this project, I utilized Python programming along with popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
The analysis process involved data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and drawing meaningful insights from the data.
# Key Findings
Explored the distribution of anxiety and depression among different age groups and genders.
Investigated correlations between anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.
Identified potential factors that could contribute to mental health issues among college students.
